The state of matter $\in \{ \rho, T \}$. A system of constituents, under an increasing $\{ \rho, T \}$, goes from weakly interacting *gas* $\rightarrow$ highly interacting *liquid* $\rightarrow$ bound state *solid* (crystal structure) fixed at periodic nodes $\rightarrow$ clustered *molecules* with overlapped nodes $\rightarrow$ delocalised *quantum liquid* 

**Quantum liquid** is the state of matter where particles, such as atoms or electrons, are not confined to fixed positions. Instead, they are spread out over a large area due to quantum effects and behaves more like waves than particles.
