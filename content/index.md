## About me 
Hi! My name is Nguyen Thi Yen Binh. I am Vietnamese. I am currently a student in Master 1 General Physics at University Paris Saclay in France. 

My interest is Cosmology and Astrophysics. I also love mathematics and programming.

#### Bachelor thesis
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization is a crucial tool for probing the mysteries of cosmic inflation through the measurement of primordial B-modes. Achieving this requires meticulous control over instrumental systematic effects. In this report, we present an instrumental model that focuses on two primary effects: intensity-to-polarization leakage and cross-polarization within a parametric component separation framework. 

We estimate the upper limits for each parameter to meet the scientific requirements for next-generation CMB measurement. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to optimize the $\chi^2$ log-likelihood function, we constrain the parameters and estimate the data volume needed to reduce statistical errors within the upper limits of the parameters. We analyze unpolarized atmospheric data with and without the use of a half-wave plate (HWP). 

Our findings indicate that polarized data is essential for fully characterizing and calibrating all parameters in the HWP model. We further explore the potential of using drone-based fully polarized data for parameter constraints.

#### Carina Keyhole
A strong ionization source can dissociate and ionize molecular hydrogen, creating an HII region around it. Thus, it is unexpected for molecules with lower ionization and dissociation potentials to survive in the proximity of an ionization source. Interestingly, previous observations reported the existence of several clumpy regions with emission from carbon monoxide molecules (CO)  in the Keyhole region, next to one of the most luminous massive stars $\eta$ Carina belonging to the Trumpler 16 cluster in the Carina nebula. 

We revisit the keyhole region in the Carina nebula with velocity-resolved observations of rotational transitions of CO and its isotopologues and of hyperfine atomic structure lines from the far infrared and millimeter bands taken from APEX and SOFIA with the aim of studying the physical and chemical properties in the regions where molecular gas is located.
