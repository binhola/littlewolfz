## Debye shielding and Debye sphere
Debye shielding is a phenomenon when we insert a test charge inside a plasma, the free charged particles inside the plasma will surround the test charge, shielding the electrostatic potential from charge. This can happen if free charges do not have enough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive potential energy of the test charge. 

From the definition of [[Debye Length]], we can define a *Debye sphere* surrounding the test particle and also the number of particle inside the sphere:
$$N_D = \dfrac{4}{3}\pi \lambda_D^3n_0$$
where $\lambda_D$ is the Debye length, $n_0$ is the number density of plasma outside the Debye sphere.

We can insert the equation of *Debye length* and get:
$$N_D = \dfrac{4}{3}\pi \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n_0}} \left(\dfrac{\epsilon_0 k_B T}{e^2}\right)^{3/2} $$
