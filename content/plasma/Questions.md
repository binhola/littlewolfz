1. Can photon exists in the fusion plasma? 
- No. Since the energy scale for fusion nuclei ~ 50keV, but the energy scale for molecules ~ 10eV => the plasma is fully ionized
2. Can we ionized gas with 1eV temperature?
	- Yes. Because plasma behave classically following the Boltzmann statistics. Even at 1eV temperature, there is a small fraction of plasma can be ionized
3. What is the conditions for electron attachments? For 1eV can $e^-$ attachment happen? How many?
4. Can we have negative ions in fushion machine?
5. Prove that Mawellian distribution is a Gaussian
6. Magnetic Bottle
