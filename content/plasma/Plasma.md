### Definition
Plasma is ionized gas with quasi-neutrality (the total charge is neutral) and collective behavior (the electromagnetic force dominates over hydrodynamic mechanics).

Plasma can be fully inonized or partially ionized. 

Examples of plasmas: 
- The Sun
- Interstellar medium
- Flourescent lighting

Most plasma behave classically, following Boltzmann statistics.
